  <legend>What did you individually accomplish this last week?</legend>
  <p>PPM<br/>
    - The goal for this week was to interact with the designers so that the final mocks could be converted into
    individual assets that could be incorporated into the application.<br/>
    - The Android landscape is highly fragmented with a multitude of screen sizes, pixel densities and screen aspect
    ratios to support. A lot of time was allotted for the developers to communicate with the designers the unique
    requirements of preparing artwork for Android.<br/>
    - Another goal was to fix bugs in the components already implemented so that the application was ready for release
    within the organization.<br/></p>
