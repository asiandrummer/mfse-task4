	This is an open marketplace process where faculty and students interview each other to find the best match.  Matches are made on a first-come, first-served basis, when both the owner and the student agree on the match.
	<br/><br/>
	When a match has occurred, the owner adds the student to their project. An email will be sent to the student telling them how to fill out the necessary paperwork.
	<br/><br/>
	If a student is taking more than 36 units, we limit the hours to 10 hours per week. If the students is taking 36 or less units,  we limit the hours to 20 hours per
        week. Note that some projects might only have enough funding for 10 hours per week.

	<td colspan="2">This project is in year 2 of a 3-year grant, and concerns the application of semantic modeling and querying techniques to demonstrate how the smart grid community can manage the large challenge of harmonizing definitions and relations among the standards being defined. The particular research will involve extending the work of Year 1, where a student developed a semantic query tool running on the Amazon cloud (see http://fsgim.sv.cmu.edu) that allowed arbitrarySPARQL queries to be applied to a model defined in OWL. A number of queries were predefined to allow people not familiar with SPARQL to explore the model. The point of this tool was to support validation of the model, checking, for example, how the datatypes were declared. Supporting this web application is a sophisticated commercial semantic modeling tool called TopBraid Composer, sold by TopQuadrant.
          In Year 2, we plan to: apply the same techniques to several other standards; extend the web query tool to allow navigation among the classes and relations via hyperlinks, using a technology called SPARQL Web Pages; explore automated suggestions for improvements to the models using automated reasoning techniques. You would be part of a team of four: one research faculty at CMU, two employees at TopQuadrant under contract to CMU, and yourself. You would be responsible for the web query tool.
          This project supports a major national effort to modernize the electrical grid, involving hundreds of companies and thousands of engineering professionals. You will have an opportunity to write a paper and present results at a national meeting.

	<td colspan="2">This project is in year 2 of a 3-year grant, and concerns the application of ontological engineering methods to the use of mobile sensor platforms in the home health management domain. To date we have defined a simple ontology and a mapping to a standard (IEEE 11073) for exchanging health monitoring data, such as blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, etc. This year we will explore two tasks:
          1.    Building a proof of concept smart phone app that automatically converts health monitoring data into IEEE 11073-compatible form using the ontology,
          2.    Apply automated reasoning techniques to validate portions of the IEEE 11073 standard after converting it into an OWLrepresentation.
